# Build

Spec: $ARGUMENTS. If empty, the spec from the conversation.

1. Read the code the change touches first: its callers and the helpers that already exist.
2. Implement it in one pass. Keep it simple: nothing the spec does not ask for.
3. End with a short list of the assumptions you made where the spec was silent.
